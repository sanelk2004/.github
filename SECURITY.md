# Security Policy

I am a huge proponent of online security, privacy, and freedom, and I try my hardest to ensure that the users of my programs do not have to sacrifice their security, privacy, or freedom to use my software. But as I am a human, I can sometimes make mistakes.

If you are a security researcher who has found a vulnerability in any of my projects, then this policy will outline the rules of my vulnerability disclosure program, how to report the vulnerability directly to me, and what I will do to ensure that you are protected as a researcher from legal liability for your research and report.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### My Promise

I am an extremely proud proponent of online security, privacy, and freedom. I strive to ensure that the users of my open-source programs do not have to sacrifice any of those fundamental rights in order to use my software. But as I am a human, sometimes I will make mistakes.

### Scope

If you are a security researcher and you believe you have found a security issue or vulnerability in any of my open-source software, I strongly encourage you to notify me directly.

| Version | In scope | Source code |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| latest  | ✅ | Any code located in any repository on https://github.com/sanelk2004 |
| latest | ✅ | `sanelkukic.us.eu.org/*` |
| latest | ✅ | `*.sanelkukic.us.eu.org/*` |

### How to Submit a Report

To submit a vulnerability report, visit my website at [sanelkukic.us.eu.org](https://sanelkukic.us.eu.org/contact), and contact me through any of the methods listed on that page. I will personally receive your submission, review it, and provide you a response within 24 hours.

### Safe Harbor

I support a safe harbor for security researchers who:

* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of my service(s).
* Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder. If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact me immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local information.
* Provide me with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party.

I will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. I will *personally* help to the extent I can if legal action is initiated by a third party against you.

Please submit a report to me before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

### Preferences

* Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact.
* Include the version number of the vulnerable package or software in your report
* Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
* Follow the terms of this vulnerability disclosure policy
