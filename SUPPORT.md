# Guide on obtaining support for any of my projects

If you ever need help using any of my projects, this document will show you how to obtain that help.

**Notice**: One of the perks I offer on my [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/sanelk2004) is faster response times from me when you submit a bug report/feature suggestion/support inquiry. You do not need to become a sponsor to receive support, however if you wish to expedite your support inquiry, then becoming a sponsor of mine on GitHub is the best way to go about doing that.

## Creating a support inquiry
This tutorial will walk you through the steps of creating a support inquiry in any of my public repositories.

- Visit the repository you wish to submit your inquiry in.
- Go to the Issues tab and select "New issue" or "Create an issue"
- Select the "Support" option
- Fill in the form that is displayed, and also **don't forget to fill in the title field at the top!**
- Confirm that you have read and agree to the terms of the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/sanelk2004/.github/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sanelk2004/.github/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Click the button to create your issue!

I will then respond to your issue as soon as I can, and will contact you via the method you specify in the form with an update.

## Alternative contact methods
If you do not wish to use the above method, or if the above method does not work for you, below you can see a list of alternative methods to contact me with your support inquiry.
